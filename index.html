						<h3>What If I donâ€™t know how to code?</h3>
						<p>No problem! One of the main points of a hackathon is to help teach students who have no prior coding experience, helping them create something great from scratch. We will have mentors and workshops to help you all night and day. All we ask from you is the willingness to learn and you can certainly create something you can be proud of.</p>
					</div>

						<h3>How much does this cost?</h3>

						<p>Short answer: nothing.
						Long answer: $0.</p>
